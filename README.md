# noble-to-ethereum-bridge
 A simple app that is a bridge that allows users to transfer USDC from Noble to Ethereum.

 
Learning and Exploration Phase

In the first three days of development, after completing my regular work, I dedicated time to reading and learning about Web3 technologies. This involved exploring various aspects of blockchain development, with a specific focus on connecting wallets and understanding how they interact with decentralized applications. During this time, I successfully integrated the MetaMask wallet for Ethereum and the Keplr wallet for Noble into the project. These wallets are crucial for enabling users to securely manage and sign transactions on their respective networks.

Researching Bridge Solutions

One of the primary challenges during the initial development phase was finding a suitable method to bridge USDC from Noble to a Sepolia (Ethereum testnet) address without using a smart contract. I spent considerable time researching different approaches and technologies that could facilitate this cross-chain transfer.

Discovery of CCTP

On the third or fourth day, specifically around Wednesday, I discovered the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP). This was a significant breakthrough in the project as CCTP provided exactly the functionality I needed to bridge USDC between the two networks. Coincidentally, on that same day, I received the mid-level assignment from Miriam, which included information about CCTP. While it was slightly disappointing to realize that the solution was included in the assignment, it also validated the approach I was taking.

Project Completion

Armed with the knowledge of CCTP, I was able to quickly implement the bridge functionality. This allowed me to complete the project by Thursday, just in time, thanks to the discovery of CCTP on Wednesday. This protocol became the cornerstone of the solution, enabling the seamless transfer of USDC from Noble to Sepolia without the need for a custom smart contract.

Conclusion

The initial days of learning and exploration were crucial in building a solid foundation for the project. Although the process involved some challenges and moments of frustration, the eventual discovery of CCTP allowed me to successfully implement the bridge solution and complete the project on time. The experience reinforced the importance of continuous learning and staying updated with emerging technologies in the fast-paced world of Web3 development.
